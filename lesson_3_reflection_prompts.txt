When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
first it can be used as a backup
second in case you are working on a project with several people, it lets you sync your work easily with the rest of the teammates

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
what if someone makes a mistake/ breaks the build, in such case i prefer not to pull that change until he fixes it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is used only on github and it is the easiest (and maybe the only) to clone remote repositories.
it also keeps track from whom you forked and purhaps how many forks have been done to the repository.
this will be used in case you would like to do some changes that you think that will suite you but not to the original repository owner.

clone is to copy a repository locally or from a remote to local.

branch is make inside the same repository - it is to split from the origin (from a cerain commit -> all commits before will be just like the origin) to another version of the project. lets lay i want to develope a new feature that will interfer with the work of the other developers until i will finish it. so i am working on a different branch until it is done and at the end i need to merge that branch back to the origin.
