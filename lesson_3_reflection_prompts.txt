When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
first it can be used as a backup
second in case you are working on a project with several people, it lets you sync your work easily with the rest of the teammates

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
what if someone makes a mistake/ breaks the build, in such case i prefer not to pull that change until he fixes it.
